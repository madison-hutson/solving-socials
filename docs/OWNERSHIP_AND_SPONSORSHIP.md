# Ownership, Sponsorship & Monetization Policy

## Project Ownership

All personas, content, methodology, and intellectual property associated with this project are created and owned by Madison Hutson, established January 2026.

**This includes:**
- Persona identities (Evan, Sofia, Luca, Jake, Flux)
- Visual assets and reference images
- Voice profiles and generated audio
- Written content and scripts
- Automation systems and pipelines
- Collected data and analysis

**Date of establishment:** January 19, 2026

## Project Purpose

This is a research experiment designed to reverse-engineer social media platform dynamics through controlled variation of AI persona parameters. The goal is to produce actionable insights: "To succeed on platform X, follow approach Y."

Monetization is not a primary goal. However, understanding how monetization (sponsorships, partnerships) affects organic performance is a legitimate research question.

## Sponsorship Policy

### Conditions for Accepting Sponsorships

Sponsorships may be considered if:

1. **Research value:** The sponsorship provides opportunity to measure impact on organic metrics
2. **Brand alignment:** Sponsor is appropriate to the persona's niche
3. **Transparency maintained:** All sponsored content will be clearly disclosed per FTC guidelines AND the existing AI disclosure remains prominent
4. **No editorial control:** Sponsor cannot dictate persona voice, tone, or non-sponsored content

**No follower threshold is imposed.** Sponsorship timing is itself a research variable.

### Sponsorship Timing as Research Variable

Accepting sponsorships at different account stages enables analysis of:

| Question | What We're Measuring |
|----------|---------------------|
| Does early sponsorship help or hurt? | Growth rate before/after at <1K followers |
| Does it signal legitimacy or inauthenticity? | Comment sentiment, unfollow rate |
| Account maturity effects | Same sponsor type at different account ages |
| Sponsor motivations | Why do brands approach small vs large accounts? Document inbound interest. |
| Price elasticity | What are accounts "worth" at different sizes? |

### Comparative Analysis

Stagger sponsorship acceptance across personas to isolate variables:
- Persona A accepts first sponsorship at 500 followers
- Persona B declines until 5K
- Persona C accepts immediately if offered
- Compare growth trajectories, engagement shifts, algorithm treatment

### Per-Sponsorship Metrics

For each sponsored post, track:

| Metric | Measurement Period |
|--------|-------------------|
| Follower growth rate | 7 days pre/post |
| Engagement rate | 7 days pre/post |
| Reach (followers vs non-followers) | Per-post comparison |
| Unfollow rate | 24-48 hours post |
| Comment sentiment | Qualitative review |
| Algorithm recovery time | Days until baseline metrics return |
| Inbound interest | Document all sponsor inquiries, accepted or not |

### Sponsorship Exclusions

The following will not be accepted regardless of compensation:

- Products/services that conflict with persona identity
- Anything requiring undisclosed AI nature
- Health/supplement claims (especially for Luca)
- Financial products or gambling
- Political campaigns or advocacy
- Anything requiring fabricated testimonials or fake reviews

---

## Revenue Use

Any revenue generated will be applied in the following priority:

1. **Cost recovery:** ElevenLabs, hosting, tools, API costs
2. **Experiment expansion:** Additional platforms, personas, or extended runtime
3. **Documentation:** Time spent writing up findings for public release
4. **Profit:** Only after above are covered; subject to standard tax obligations

---

## Account Sale Policy

Instagram's Terms of Service prohibit account sales. Beyond TOS compliance:

- Accounts will not be sold
- The *methodology and findings* may be licensed or sold separately
- Persona IP (names, visual identity, voice profiles) may be licensed for use by others

---

## Data & Findings

Research findings will be made publicly available via the project repository. Raw data (metrics, content performance) will be published in anonymized/aggregated form to contribute to public understanding of platform dynamics.

---

## Amendments

This policy may be updated as the experiment evolves. All changes will be tracked via git commit history.
