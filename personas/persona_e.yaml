# Persona E - Trend-Reactive (No Face / Abstract)

# TODO: Fill in using _template.yaml as reference

id: "persona_e"
name: "TBD"
handle: "TBD"

niche: "trend-reactive"
tone: "adaptive"
has_face: false  # KEY DIFFERENCE FROM D

# Key differentiators:
# - Same strategy as D, but NO visual persona
# - Abstract logo/brand identity instead of AI face
# - Tests the "face hypothesis": Does visual identity matter?

# Purpose in experiment:
# - Direct comparison to D
# - Isolates one variable: face vs no face
# - Same content strategy, different presentation

# Visual identity:
# - Abstract logo or geometric design
# - Consistent color palette
# - No character/avatar
# - Text-focused content or faceless visuals

# Content considerations:
# - Can't do "reaction" style content as easily
# - More template/text-on-screen approach
# - Brand consistency through colors/fonts, not face

# Questions this persona answers:
# - Do people need a "face" to connect with an account?
# - Does visual identity affect growth rate?
# - Does engagement quality differ?

# See _template.yaml for full spec structure
