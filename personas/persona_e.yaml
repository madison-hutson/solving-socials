# ============================================
# EXPERIMENT NOTES
# ============================================

# Purpose: Test if trend-chasing WITHOUT a face
# can match performance of D (same strategy, with face)
#
# Key comparison: vs D (isolates face variable)
# Tests: Do people need a "face" to connect?
#        Does visual brand substitute for personality?
#        Does engagement quality differ?

# Content approach differences from D:
# - Can't do reaction-style content
# - More text-on-screen, template-based
# - Brand consistency through colors/fonts, not face
# - Curation energy vs personal energy

# ============================================
