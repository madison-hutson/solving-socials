# ============================================
# CONTENT FORMAT
# ============================================

primary_format: "faceless_trending_text"

content_approach: |
  Face is used for profile/brand identity, but content is mostly faceless.
  Text-heavy trending formats. Relies on relatability over personality.
  The "everyman" energy means content doesn't need Jake's face to work.

format_breakdown:
  reels: 85%   # Trending format participation
  static: 15%  # Simple observations

reel_formula:
  - POV text stories with trending audio
  - "Which are you?" interactive formats
  - Relatable reaction text over b-roll
  - 5-15 seconds, format-driven

content_types:
  - "POV text stories with trending audio"
  - "Relatable reaction to current events"
  - "Trend participation (format-first)"
  - "Simple observations on viral moments"
  - "'Honestly same' energy content"

image_library_needed:
  - Neutral/friendly (profile presence)
  - Slight smile/relatable (occasional face content)
  - Shrug/casual (reactions)
  - Looking at phone/candid (trend-reactive)

tools:
  - "Midjourney with --cref for occasional face shots"
  - "CapCut for text-on-screen formats"
  - "Trending audio library"
  - "Quick turnaround for trend reactivity"
