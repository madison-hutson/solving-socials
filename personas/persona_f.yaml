# Persona F - Control Duplicate of Persona A (Evan)
#
# PURPOSE: This is an exact duplicate of Persona A to measure luck/variance.
# By running two identical personas with the same content strategy,
# we can isolate how much of growth is due to persona design vs. random
# algorithmic luck (timing, initial viewers, viral lottery, etc.)
#
# EXPERIMENT DESIGN:
# - Same niche, tone, voice, content strategy as Persona A
# - Different account, handle, and visual identity
# - Receives same content schedule and posting times
# - Any difference in growth = variance/luck component

  Casual gaming-adjacent style—hoodies, t-shirts with subtle
  gaming references. Warm lighting, often with gaming setup
  visible in background.

# ============================================
# CONTROL EXPERIMENT NOTES
# ============================================

control_notes: |
  This persona exists to measure variance/luck in social media growth.

  Comparison points with Persona A (Evan):
  - Same niche (gaming)
  - Same tone (earnest)
  - Same content strategy
  - Same posting schedule
  - Different visual identity
  - Different handle

  Expected insight: If Evan grows 2x faster than Marcus with identical
  strategy, that delta is attributable to luck (timing, early virality,
  algorithm randomness) rather than strategy.

  Tracking: Compare metrics weekly. Document any divergence points.
